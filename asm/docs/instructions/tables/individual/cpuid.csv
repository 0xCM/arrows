| 27    | SS       | Self Snoop. The processor supports the management of conflicting memory types by performing a snoop of its own cache structure for transactions issued to the bus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 28    | HTT      | Max APIC IDs reserved field is Valid. A value of 0 for HTT indicates there is only a single logical processor in the package and software should assume only a single APIC ID is reserved. A value of 1 for HTT indicates the value in CPUID.1.EBX[23:16] (the Maximum number of addressable IDs for logical processors in this package) is valid for the package.                                                                        |
| 29    | TM       | Thermal Monitor. The processor implements the thermal monitor automatic thermal control circuitry (TCC).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30    | Reserved | Reserved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31    | PBE      | Pending Break Enable. The processor supports the use of the FERR#/PBE# pin when the processor is in the stop-clock state (STPCLK# is asserted) to signal the processor that an interrupt is pending and that the processor should return to normal operation to handle the interrupt. Bit 10 (PBE enable) in the IA32_MISC_ENABLE MSR enables this capability.                                                                            |
